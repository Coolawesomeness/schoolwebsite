             <p class="list-group-item-text">Hybrid learning is beneficial for the people who want to have more experience of going to school. Ever since the pandemic was there, most of the students had to have school online. Now, limited people can go to school and get the full experience of learning, without getting sick. One of the biggest reasons kids need to go to school is to socialize and talk to their friends. Hybrid learning lets kids socialize without getting sick. Parents also believe that younger kids can't sit on the screen for the whole day. Kids can now have fun and not get sick at the same time. An article online said that most of the kids in the United States hate the pandemic. They hate that they can't hang out with their friends and they also hate that they can't go outside. School is one of the only ways kids can hang out with their friends.</p>

        <h4>Plans to Expand School</h4>

        <p class="list-group-item-text">A proposal is set to come before city officals to discuss the expansion of Granger Middle School. The plan would increase the size of the campus and accomodate an extra 220 students. The new building would be used by students during the day but would also be available to the community school hours."This new center would both expand the school's population and give a new recreational center for people in our community. It would be a great addition to District 204 students," said Mr.Davenport. Although the new plan would allow more people to send their kids to a school closer to home, some think that it would pose more problems for the surrounding area.  </p>
